Bugs

- Edit user page display the default and not the current settings for drop down menus choices

-be able to change budget for summer to be cheaper

Improvements:

- Tracking expenses should be at top of page WIP

- Housing/food budget too high

- Has a name for the program been decided? “Waterloo Banking Budget”

- Tracking page would benefit from income entries

- Tracking page would benefit from ability to edit the date of the entry (if the expense/income happened on a day other than the current day)

- once functionality is tested add in visual representation of plan and expense breakdown
