Bugs:
- get error when password is wrong

- On the planning page if enter a value with a comma in it, then it will not save. (ex. 2,400.00)

- On the tracking page if you enter a comma or letter or leave the field blank or a very large number, then the webpage will return an invalid operation error/crash

- Edit user page display the default and not the current settings for drop down menus choices

Improvements:

- Tracking expenses should be at top of page WIP

- Housing/food budget too high

- Has a name for the program been decided? “Waterloo Banking Budget”

- Tracking page would benefit from income entries

- Tracking page would benefit from ability to edit the date of the entry (if the expense/income happened on a day other than the current day)

- once functionality is tested add in visual representation of plan and expense breakdown
